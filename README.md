# CS305
Overview

This repository contains my submission for CS 305: Software Security â€“ Project Two. The artifact included here is the Practices for Secure Software Report, which documents my process of identifying vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices for the client Artemis Financial.

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops customized financial plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. As part of modernizing their software, they required a focus on secure communications and data integrity to protect client information.

Reflection

Client and Requirements
Artemis Financial requested guidance on securing their software systems, particularly the implementation of checksum verification and HTTPS to ensure safe transmission of financial data.

Strengths and Importance of Secure Coding
I effectively identified vulnerabilities and demonstrated practices for mitigating risks. Secure coding is critical because it protects against exploitation, safeguards client trust, and ensures compliance with financial industry standards. For a company like Artemis Financial, software security directly contributes to customer confidence and business stability.

Challenges and Learning
A challenging aspect was running static dependency analysis and interpreting vulnerability results. This process deepened my understanding of how software libraries can introduce risks and the importance of ongoing security testing.

Layers of Security
The report details how additional layers of security were addressed, including encryption, checksum verification, and secure communication protocols. In the future, I would use tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analyzers, and penetration testing frameworks to evaluate vulnerabilities and select mitigation strategies.

Ensuring Security and Functionality
The project emphasized testing and validation to confirm that changes not only secured the application but also preserved functionality. This involved reviewing reports, following best practices, and ensuring no new vulnerabilities were introduced after improvements.

Resources and Best Practices
I applied industry best practices such as using strong cryptographic methods, enforcing HTTPS, and validating code through dependency scanning. These approaches will continue to be useful in future coursework and professional development.

Value to Employers
This artifact demonstrates my ability to:

Assess vulnerabilities and recommend solutions.

Apply secure software development practices.

Use industry tools to validate security compliance.

Document the process clearly for stakeholders.
